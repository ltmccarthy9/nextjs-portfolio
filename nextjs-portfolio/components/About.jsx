            Full stack web developer with a degree in economics. 
            I recently earned a certificate in full stack web development 
            from a boot camp by the University of California - Berkeley. 
            As a graduate of this boot camp, I have over a hundred hours of 
            experience building full-stack applications both individually and in teams. 
            Beyond Javascript and HTML5/CSS, I am experienced in React, mySQL, mongoDB, 
            REST APIs, ORMs, git workflow, and more. I am a quick learner with strong 
            analytical skills as well as a deeply creative side. Iâ€™m excited to bring my 
            skills and creativity to a forward thinking team to provide better online 
            experiences.
